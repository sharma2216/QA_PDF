Each \nPerformance Criteria (PC) will be assigned marks proportional to its importance in NOS. SSC will also \nlay down the proportion of marks for Theory and Skills Practical for each PC. \nThe assessment for the theory part will be based on a knowledge bank of questions created by the \nSSC. Assessment will be conducted for all compulsory NOS, and where applicable, on the selected \nelective/option NOS/set of NOS. \nGuidelines for Assessment \nTesting Environment \nTasks and Functions \nProductivity \nTeamwork \n\u2022 \nCarry out \nassessments \nunder realistic \nwork pressures \nthat are found in \nthe normal \nindustry \nworkplace (or \nsimulated \nworkplace). \n\u2022 \nEnsure that the \nrange of materials, \nequipment and \ntools that learners \nuse are current \nand of the type \nroutinely found in \nthe normal \nindustry \nworkplace (or \nsimulated \nworkplace) \nenvironments. \n\u2022 \nAssess that all \ntasks and \nfunctions are \ncompleted in a \nway, and to a \ntimescale, that is \nacceptable in the \nnormal industry \nworkplace. \n\u2022 \nAssign workplace \n(or simulated \nworkplace) \nresponsibilities \nthat enable \nlearners to meet \nthe requirements \nof the NOS. \n\u2022 \nProductivity levels \nmust be checked \nto ensure that it \nreflects those that \nare found in the \nwork situation \nbeing replicated. \n\u2022 \nProvide situations \nthat allow \nlearners to \ninteract with the \nrange of \npersonnel and \ncontractors found \nin the normal \nindustry \nworkplace (or \nsimulated \nworkplace). \n \nAssessment Quality Assurance framework \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n \n20 | AI- Data Quality Analyst  \nNASSCOM provides two assessment frameworks NAC and NAC-Tech. \nNAC (NASSCOM Assessment of Competence) \nNAC follows a test matrix to assess Speaking & Listening, Analytical, Quantitative, Writing, and \nKeyboard skills of candidates appearing for assessment. \nNAC-Tech  \nNAC-Tech test matrix includes assessment of Communication, Reading, Analytical, Logical Reasoning, \nWork Management, Computer Fundamentals, Operating Systems, RDBMS, SDLC, Algorithms & \nProgramming Fundamentals, and System Architecture skills. \n \nMethods of Validation \nTo pass a QP, a trainee should score an average of 70% or more. In case of unsuccessful completion, \nthe trainee may seek reassessment on the Qualification Pack.  \nMethod of assessment documentation and access \nThe assessment agency will upload the result of assessment in the portal. The data will not be \naccessible for change by the assessment agency after the upload. The assessment data will be \nvalidated by SSC assessment team. After upload, only SSC can access this data. \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n \n21 | AI- Data Quality Analyst  \nRecommended Supplemental Readings \n \nThe learning modules covered in the Model Curriculum for AI-Data Quality Analyst are designed to \nmeet the expected outcomes as per the QP. While the modules aligned to NOS are focused on \ntechnical/ behavioral competencies, bridge modules cover the prerequisite/ preparatory topics that \nare indispensable to complete the course. However, to provide additional QP specific knowledge to \nthe learners, the following supplemental readings on related topics are recommended.
